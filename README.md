## Getting Started

### Installation

Add the NanoDB dependency to your project:

```
implementation 'com.magnatesage.nanodb:nanodb:1.0.0'
```

### Usage

Define your data models using NanoDB annotations:

```
@CollectionName("users")
data class User(
  @PrimaryKey val id: String,
  val name: String,
  @Nullable val email: String?,
  @Indexed val age: Int
)
```

Initialize the database and perform operations:

```
val db = NanoDB.getInstance(context)

db.insert(User("1", "John Doe", "john@example.com", 30))
val users = db.query<User> { it.age > 18 }
```

## Migration

Manage schema changes easily with versioning:

```
NanoDB.migrate(1) { oldData ->
  // transform oldData to new schema format
}
```
